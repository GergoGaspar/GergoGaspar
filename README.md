- 👋 Hi, I’m @GergoGaspar from Budapest, Hungary. I am a 21 years old student. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, challeneges and video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# in a hungarian course. We're getting there. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a lot of people, but first I'd like to get a steady programming background.
- 📫 How to reach me? Good question. Through the Force, I guess?
